## Description
This board was made to help automate steam train management in an NPO. It is used to send status signals to a central server through LoRaWAN so the workers donâ€™t have to go on site and check the states. There will also be an expansion board with relays to switch certain peripherals remotely.
It is equipped with 6 individual 24v tolerant isolated digital inputs. It can also be powered by 24v DC because it uses a buck converter to step the voltage down to 3.3v
Here are some other specifications:
* Microcontroller: ATSAMD21J18
* Flash: 256KB
* SRAM: 64KB
* Frequency: 48MHz
* ADC: 20-Channel 12bit
* DAC: Single-Channel 10bit 
* Pins: 52 GPIO pins
